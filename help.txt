Reset Password:
	This button when clicked will pull up a panel on the right side of the 
	screen. This panel will ask you what you want your new password to be 
	and to confirm the new password. This will then set the password for 
	all future uses.
	
Reset Quiz:
	After a quiz has been used, the user's answers are saved. When a user 
	answers incorrectly 10 times or has answered correctly, they cannot 
	return to the question. If they try to go back to the question, it 
	will just bring up the answer page of the question. Reseting the quiz 
	allows the quiz to be taken again. This means all the user's answers 
	are erased and clicking on a question will bring them to the question 
	page instead of the answer page.

Set Quiz Title:
	This will set the window's title when the quiz window is opened.

	to go with the question. When you have finished click the new button
	'Add Question' and this will add the question to the quiz.

	button.

Change Answer:
	This button, when clicked, will bring up the list of questions with
	numbers attatched to them. It will then ask for a number of the
	question in which you would like to change the answer to, and it
	will ask for the new answer you want for the question. When you are
	done you should then click the 'Make Change' button and it will
	change the answer to the question.
